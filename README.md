This repository contains my personal configuration for Emacs.

### A word of warning

This is a **work in progress**. ðŸš§

Whilst most of the code featured in this repository contains informative names, docstrings, and comments, there are some dark spots.  This is because I have been refining my configuration over the years, electing to keep as much of my old code as possible when refactoring.  The consequence of that is that some of the older functions are written in *Baby Elisp*, dating back to a time when programming for me was more *alchemy* than *science*.

### Goal ðŸš€

A `1.0` version of this project would be a documented, fully-modularised configuration Ã  la [purcell](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d), and I am about half-way there.

In the meantime, feel free to explore the functions Iâ€™ve written.  Iâ€™ve invested a lot of time on my `org-agenda` config, and you might be interested in checking some of the helper functions Iâ€™ve written to organise my custom agenda-views.

### Questions?

If you have any question, you can find me on **IRC** (channel **#ranger** on freenode).
